    title: "Why I'm not donating to your charity, or my personal philosophy on how to ethically run companies.",
    date: '2024-12-25',
    excerpt: "An exploration of charity models, business ethics, and why the traditional charity approach might not be the most effective way to create lasting positive change.",
    content: `We all know the feeling when you start walking into a store and there is a little stall at the front with people (akin to beggars), asking you to donate money to <insert some good cause>. Hell, I only needed to get some flour and eggs.

Now, don't get me wrong - I don't have a problem with their mission. I have a problem with their method of execution and fundamentally their ethics. I'm going to spell out the two basic vehicles that businesses fall under.

When creating a charity, one might ask why? Why create a charity? Well at a surface level its usually warm and fuzzy feelings:
• We feed the poor
• We fly people in rural areas to hospitals
• We clothe the poor
• We train guide dogs
• We help support kids over in 3rd world countries to eat

Whatever it is, it's "typically" viewed as a noble cause - not one that could be frowned upon.

So once someone has come up with this <noble cause idea> then you have to go convince people to start giving you money so you can then start doing <noble actions> as shit costs money.

The mechanics of the inner workings of a charity - I do not want to go into here, but how many charities are either:
• Created by a company for tax purposes
• Created by a person who actually cared and did the work (and didn't take money per se but allowed helpers - these organisations usually start small and take a long time to grow if they ever do)
• Created by a company to hire family
• Created by a church
• Created by a school
• Created by a hospital
• Created by a government

To run an organisation you need money. If you run out, your org dies. So then, how many of these charities are just sitting ducks when it comes to their <method of execution>? How many are about to run out of money? How much does it cost to run their particular area?

The formula for when a company is going to die is simple (read as "runway"):
numberOfDaysWeCanStillOperate = amountOfMoneyInTheBank / costToRunOrganisation per day

Of course this is a gross oversimplification however it's 99% there. The edge cases in this scenario are things like organisations that find volunteers vs having to find donors to fund their cause.

It seems like a cruel joke when you can see what is going on, why is it up to the guy filling up his car with fuel and asked to round up and donate to some cause that makes you an asshole for not giving the 15 cents. But let me remind you that Coles profited 1.13 Billion dollars in 2024 yet they are asking you to round up to feed the kids?

The critical thinkers in the room will probably be saying something like, well that is a clever way to provide unlimited runway to your charity.

And whilst on one hand you are correct, you have only done that. Provided a means for a for-profit company that profits in the billions to instead of paying for people to stand at the front of shops or in call centres - to instead make the person that has to work at the fuel station ask the "will you donate".

Would it be so crazy to profit less and give more?
Would it be so crazy to simply build a <business model> that has charity built in?
Would it be so crazy to have a "you buy one, we donate one" model?
Would it be so crazy to build companies ethically?
Would it be so crazy to start treating people like people?

Examples like the fast food place Zambrero's; where they donate one meal for every meal purchased. This is not only a scalable business model - but in many ways it's a way of protecting the people that the charity helps.

Think about it, let's say a charity is created like the royal flying doctors - they hire a bunch of people to raise money so they can hire pilots and lease planes. It's all rosy until you have to fire everyone and they have families and it's Christmas. So we don't want to create these layers of dependencies as little Tommy out in the field may have not gone and played with his brother and broken his leg; which requires a flying doctor which requires a pilot waiting on standby which requires a plane which requires a person to service it.

The waves from the boat roll for miles.

So please, if you are the type of person that has to found a company, found it right and cultivate a giving community and lead by example. You have not only a duty of care to yourself, to your shareholders (which should be your employees) and mostly to the rest of the world.

I believe for-profit companies are akin to an eye for an eye (ps it leaves the world either blind or broke).

We cannot currently change the laws to enforce these ideals, but in a way we are given such a great metric to be able to view the status of the mean (pun intended) ethics of a company is by if they start to adopt a set of "guidelines" for ethically running a company.

Please think for yourself and be nice to your neighbours - you never know when you are going to need some flour and eggs.`

    title: "Cutting boards need feet, or why being a purist and pragmatic are mutually exclusive",
    date: '2025-01-01',
    excerpt: "An exploration of the tension between purism and pragmatism through the lens of cutting board design, and why sometimes compromising on ideals leads to better outcomes.",
    content: `You can't sell cutting boards without feet without people returning the boards in a few months. Why?

Well turns out typical people don't know what happens when they clean their cutting boards.

End grain cutting boards are a lot of work, the purist in me tells me it's crazy to put feet on the board. After all, why is an end grain cutting board so good? Well without getting into the exact why - the reason is: A side grain cutting board (note, they are never marketed as this) will slowly get cut up and the timber will flake away over time. An end grain cutting board won't have this happen, it's a lot harder to make any lasting cuts on them.

Because of the way these boards are made, it means technically you can use them on both sides, but there is a catch. If you for some reason, leave water underneath it, or it's a very wet day - due to the nature of timber (it moves only in one plane) it will, what's called "cup" - ie, it won't be flat anymore! Now technically you can fix this by wetting the other side letting it cup the other way and then drying it correctly. This is not something normal people are going to do.

So the purist gets caught in the fire - do they:
• Double the surface area, ie use both sides and if they give them to family give the directions on the fact that you should place a mini towel under it
• Or simply put feet on it and be done with it

Now, the reason why the cutting board is the perfect analogy for purist vs pragmatic because often the purist is trapped within an echo chamber of pureness. They are not looking at things through the prism of holistic nature as if they were they would understand the fact that end grain cutting boards will last a lifetime, so the real data points they are choosing from are the following:
• High risk but double sides
• Low risk but have to compromise perceived values

Ironically, from an aesthetics point of view, having 4mm tiny feet underneath it - gives it amazing shadow.

Sidenote:
It's not that being a purist and pragmatic aren't mutually exclusive. I like to think of the definition within this sense differently:
The pragmatic purist: A purist that can compromise.`

    title: "Teaching in context works, or why the best learning is when you think you aren't being taught",
    date: '2025-01-15',
    excerpt: "An exploration of how contextual learning and creative engagement could transform education, using the evolution of spell-checking as a lens to understand deeper truths about how we learn.",
    content: `The evolution of spell-checking technology tells us something profound about how we might transform education. In the past, spell-checkers simply underlined errors in red, offering corrections through a right-click menu. While some users might have learned from this process, most simply clicked and moved on, treating it as a tool for correction rather than learning. Today's systems offer auto-suggestions and quick completions – more efficient, perhaps, but still prioritizing convenience over education.

THE POWER OF CONTEXT
Imagine a future where these tools adapt to individual learning patterns, understanding context and adjusting their assistance accordingly. This shift from assistive technology to educational technology mirrors the difference between handing someone a calculator and teaching them mathematics. It's not just about getting the right answer; it's about building understanding through context.

This context-dependent learning reflects a deeper truth about education: genuine problem-solving requires understanding the broader picture. Just as machine learning models need context to suggest appropriate words, students need meaningful connections to truly grasp concepts. Yet our current educational system often fails to provide these connections, leaving students with abstract knowledge they struggle to apply.

THE HIDDEN CRISIS IN TEACHING
The challenges run deeper than just teaching methods. Consider the experience of a science and math teacher who recently switched to tutoring because the baseline noise level in a classroom of 20-30 students made teaching nearly impossible. This isn't an isolated incident - many talented educators struggle with large group instruction, finding it akin to public speaking. For teachers sensitive to such environments, traditional classrooms become almost untenable, leading to inevitable burnout or exit from the profession.

As we face a growing teacher shortage, we must acknowledge that our current system isn't designed to address these fundamental problems. Consider Thomas Edison, labeled as 'addled' by his teachers, who ultimately thrived through home schooling.

Today, we face a serious deficit in creativity - not just artistic expression, but the broader ability to create, whether that's writing books, developing applications, building rockets, or composing music. Humans can either consume or create, and everything we consume was once someone's creation.

REIMAGINING EDUCATION
A solution might lie in radically rethinking how we structure education. Imagine a system where students who demonstrate active creation in any field receive significant flexibility in their traditional schooling. This isn't just about reducing classroom time; it's about rewarding creative engagement that exercises the mind in meaningful ways.

This new framework would also bring back teachers who left due to environmental stress, placing them in smaller classes of around six students. In these intimate settings, education becomes truly contextual. A student building bottle rockets in their creative time can bring that passion to math class, where the entire group might work on calculating flight trajectories.

THE PATH FORWARD
Implementation would require dynamic testing methods, likely powered by AI and language models, to assess learning in ways that reflect individual paths while maintaining measurable standards. While this vision might seem utopian, the best problem-solving often starts with imagining an ideal end state, then working backward to determine practical steps.

This isn't just about teaching differently - it's about creating an environment where learning happens naturally, where creation is celebrated, and where both students and teachers can thrive within their natural tendencies rather than fighting against them.

The key elements for success include:
• Creating spaces where teachers can work within their natural strengths, not against them
• Enabling students to learn through their interests and creative pursuits
• Maintaining small class sizes that allow for true contextual learning
• Using technology to support and enhance learning, not just to correct mistakes

The path forward requires pragmatic choices about what we can implement now and what must wait. But the core vision remains: an educational system that serves both students and teachers while preparing learners for real-world creation and problem-solving.`
